EYE CONTROL INTERFACE 

 In today's digital age, accessibility to technology is paramount for individuals with disabilities,
 ensuring their independence and inclusion in various aspects of life. To address this need, the Eye
 Control Interface (ECI) project was conceived and implemented. The ECI project aims to provide a
 user-friendly solution for individuals with disabilities, particularly those with mobility
 impairments, by leveraging eye-tracking technology to facilitate interaction with digital kiosks in
 public venues.

 WORKING:

 Detect the movement of eye by detecting the position of iris present in our eyes
 this can be done by converting the recorded image into edges and counters, here we use
 regression tree algorithm or Decision trees algorithm. This algorithm is used to give the best
 possible outcomes of the eye position using the decision tree algorithm so that the eye
 movement is detected and the mouse moves accordingly. It also enables the user to open and
 close the applications by blinking of the eye
